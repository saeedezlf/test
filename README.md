### README

#### Description
This Python script reads an image, performs some preprocessing, and then extracts regions of interest from it. These regions are then flattened and saved along with their corresponding labels in a CSV file.

#### Dependencies
- numpy
- matplotlib
- opencv-python

#### Usage
1. Ensure that you have Python installed on your system along with the required dependencies.
2. Update the file path `r'C:\MachineLearning\image0.jpeg'` with the path to your desired image.
3. Run the script.

#### Code Explanation
1. The script reads an image in grayscale mode using OpenCV.
2. Preprocessing steps are applied to the image, including thresholding and cropping to extract the regions of interest.
3. Ten regions (`a0` to `a9`) are defined based on specific coordinates within the image.
4. Each region is flattened to convert it into a one-dimensional array.
5. An array of target labels (`target`) is created.
6. The flattened regions and their corresponding labels are stacked vertically and then horizontally to form a single array (`num`).
7. The array `num` is saved as a CSV file named `numbers.csv` in the specified directory.

#### Note
- This script assumes that the image file is located at the specified path. Make sure to update the file path accordingly.
- Depending on your specific use case, you may need to adjust the cropping coordinates and region definitions (`a0` to `a9`).
